### What is Computer Network?
- Computer Network means, a collection of Computers, and other devices, or peripherals connected together through connecting media

### Peripheral Device
- A computer device, such as CD-ROM drive or printer, that is not part of the essential computer, i.e., the memory and microprocessor. 
- Peripheral devices can be external – such as mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner.
- Peripheral devices can be internal, such as CD-ROM drive, or internal modem.
- Internal peripheral devices are often refered to as integrated peripherals.

### Classifications of Networks
- According to Covered Area
- According to Network Model
- According to Network Topology

### Area Networks
- Local Area Networks
  - A LAN is a group of computers connected in small geographical area
  - Allow users to share files and services
- Wide Area Networks
  - A WAN is a group of computers connected in Large geographical area such as country 
  - A WAN often connects two LANs (WAN Link)
- Metropolitan Area Networks 
  - A MAN connects an area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city

### Network Models
Two basic types of networks
- Peer-to-Peer Networks
- Client/Server Networks

### Peer-to-Peer Networks
- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal; they all have the same abilities to use the resources available on the network. 
- Example : Windows Workgroup

<img alt="Cisco Router" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/030.png" />

### Client / Server Networks
- Some nodes (SERVER) are dedicated to present services to other nodes (CLIENTS)
- Examples: 
  - Mail Server
  - Web Server

<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/032.png" />

### Network Topologies
- Topology refers to the shape of a network, or the network's layout.
- How different nodes in a network are connected to each other and how they communicate are determined by the network's topology. 
- The choice of topology is dependent upon 
  - Type and number of equipment being used 
  - Cost 

### Network Topologies
Computer networks topologies
- Bus
- Star
- Ring
- Mesh
- Hybrid

### Bus Topology
All devices are connected to a central cable, called the bus or backbone
<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/033.png" />

### Bus Topology
- Both ends of the network must be terminated with a terminator
- A barrel connector can be used to extend the network
<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/034.png" />

- The backbone functions as a shared communication medium 
- Device wanting to communicate with another device on the network sends a message onto the backbone
 - The message is heard by all stations, but only the intended recipient actually accepts and processes the message. 
- Terminator absorbs frames at end of medium

### Frame Transimission - Bus LAN
- Station C want to transmit a frame of data to station A.
<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/035.png" />

### Bus Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages
  - Simple, easy to use and construct
  - Requires least amount of cable (less expensive)

- Disadvantages
  - A faulty cable will take the entire LAN down 
  - Difficult to troubleshoot
  - Heavy network traffic can slow bus considerably

### Star Topology
- A physical Star topology connects the devices via a centralized unit such as a Hub or Switch
- Nodes communicate across the network by passing data through the central device

<img alt="Star Topology" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/036.png" />

### Star Types
- Broadcasted Star Topology (Hubbed Star)
- Switched Star Topology (Switched Star)
<img alt="Star Types" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/037.png" />

### Star Advantages
- Single computer failure doesn’t bring down whole network
- Adding new devices to a Star network is very simple compared to any of the other topologies
- No disruptions to the network when connecting or removing devices. 
- Centralized control 
- Centralized network/hub monitoring 
Easy to troubleshoot

### Star Disadvantages
- If central device fails, the whole network fails
- Compared to the bus topology, a star network generally requires more cable
- More expensive than linear bus topologies because of the cost of the central device 

### Hubbed Star Rule
- Hubs simply pass on all the information they receive
- This limits the number of hubs you can connect together
- The maximum number of allowed repeater hops is four

### Ring Topology
- All devices are connected to one another in the shape of a closed loop, so that each device is connected directly to two other devices, one on either side of it
- Data is passed one way from device to device

<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/039.png" />

### Ring Topology
- A short message (called a token) is circulated around the ring, being passed from station to station.
- The token originates from a controller or master station which inserts it onto the ring. 
- A station which wants to transmit waits for the token to arrive. 
- When the token arrives, the station changes it from a token to a connector message, and appends its message. This new message is then placed on the outgoing side of the ring. 
- Each station passes on received tokens if they have nothing to transmit. 
- They monitor connector messages to see if the message is addressed to them. 
- If connector messages are addressed to them, they copy the message, modify it to signify its receipt, then send it on around the ring. 
- Connector messages which are not addressed to them are passed directly on to the next station in the ring. 
- When the connector message travels full circle and arrives at the original sending station, it checks the message to see if it's been received. It then discards the message and replaces it with a token. 

### Ring Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages 
  - Perform well under heavy traffic

- Disadvantages
  - If one device/cable fails then the whole network goes down. 
  - Difficult to troubleshoot
  - Adding/Removing computers disrupts the whole network

### Mesh Topology
- In a mesh topology each device/PC is connected to every other device/PC in the network by its own cable 

<img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/040.png" />

### Mesh Types
- FUll Mesh
- Partial Mesh

### Mesh Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages
  - Mesh topology boasts the highest fault tolerance of all of the network topologies 

- Disadvantages
  - Because each connection needs its own cable a Mesh topology can get very expensive

### Hybrid Topologies
- Hybrid means that there is more than one topology exist

- Stared Bus
  - Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone 
  <img alt="Client / Server Model" src="https://github.com/helghareeb/courses/blob/master/computer_networks/ITI/intake_38/Day_01/img/041.png" />

### Hybrid Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages
  - Network expansion is simple

- Disadvantages
  - If hub fails connections between failed hub and other hubs will fail
